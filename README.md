# Google Place API Automation Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a BDD API automation framework developed to test Google Maps Place APIs such as Add Place, Get Place, Update Place, and Delete Place. The framework is built using Java, Cucumber, Rest Assured, and TestNG with Allure integration for detailed reporting.

## Technologies Used

- Java 11  
- Maven  
- Cucumber BDD  
- Rest Assured  
- TestNG  
- SLF4J + Logback for Logging  
- Allure for Test Reporting  

## Project Structure



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/KesavaPraveen/GooglePlaceApi-TestAutomation.git
   cd GooglePlaceApi-TestAutomation
   
2. Update API key in `src/test/resources/config.properties`:
   base.uri=https://rahulshettyacademy.com
   
3. Build project and download dependencies:
   mvn clean compile

4. Run tests:
   mvn test

5. Generate and view Test Report:
   mvn allure:serve

   
## How to Use This Framework

- Write Gherkin feature files under `src/test/resources/features`.
- Implement step definitions inside `stepdefinitions` package.
- Add request/response POJOs in `pojos` package.
- Configure reusable API calls in `utils/ApiClient.java`.
- Manage environment-specific data in `config.properties`.
- Execute tests via TestNG runner configured in `runners` package.
- Review detailed reports generated by Allure.

## Contribution & Version Control

- Commit messages should clearly reflect the step or feature added.
- Follow branching and PR protocols as per your Git workflow.
- Commit often with small logical changes to maintain easy rollback and review.

**Example commit messages:**

- “Step 1: Maven setup and folder structure”
- “Step 2: ConfigManager class and config properties”
- “Step 3: POJOs for all API payloads and responses”
- “Step 4: ApiClient and Logging integration”
- “Step 5: Step definitions and feature files”
- “Step 6: Allure reporting setup”

## Future Enhancements

- Add OAuth or other authentication mechanisms.
- Implement parallel test execution.
- Integrate with Jenkins/GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Support other Google Maps APIs.
- Add screenshots/log attachments on failure to reports.
